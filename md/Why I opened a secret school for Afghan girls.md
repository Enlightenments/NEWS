> When the Taliban cracked down on girls’ education, one woman knew what she had to do

By Neggeen Sadid

The first sign that the Taliban knew about Roya Azimi’s secret school for girls was when one of her neighbours phoned her last winter. “Tomorrow, they’ll take you away, they’ll take your husband,” the man said coldly. He owned a shop in the area and acted as an unofficial intermediary between local residents and the Taliban. “It’s not my responsibility. I’m just warning you.”

Azimi, 33, set up the school in her home [in 2022](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/12/05/the-secret-life-of-afghans-under-the-taliban), when the Taliban issued a de facto ban on secondary education for girls. She and six other women teach about 150 girls between the ages of nine and 18. Knowing there was a chance her house would come under suspicion, she had already found a back-up building with enough room for the pupils. The day after the phone call she went out into the snow-covered streets, whiteboard and markers hidden under her burqa, and set up the new classroom.

But it wasn’t the end of Azimi’s troubles. A few weeks later one of her teachers, a woman called Najela Muradi, saw something that made her heart skip a beat: a green Ford pickup truck parked in the street outside. America had brought thousands of trucks into the country to supply the Afghan police – now they belonged to the Taliban. As Muradi walked down the road, the vehicle prowled behind her. When she got home she called Azimi, her voice shaking with fear.

Azimi already knew they had a problem – a neighbour had phoned to tell her that officers from the Ministry of Virtue and Vice, the Taliban’s notorious religious enforcement agency, had tried to enter the school. The neighbour managed to persuade the men that it was just a girls’ sewing class, and they left. But Azimi knew they could easily come back. She decided to close the school for a few days, telling the girls that the staff needed to revise the curriculum.

She wasn’t sure what the consequences would be if they got caught. Since the Taliban [returned to power in 2021](https://www.economist.com/1843/2021/08/13/hiding-books-buying-burqas-afghanistan-prepares-for-taliban-rule) they have issued 75 edicts aimed at keeping women in the home and have arrested people for protesting against them. It is likely that someone found to be educating girls would be severely punished by the Taliban.

The teachers met to discuss what they should do, talking in a corridor so that no one could see them through the windows. Some of them thought they should close the school altogether, fearing that the Taliban would arrest them. Others argued that the next generation of women relied on them to keep hope alive. In the end they decided to keep the school open.

Azimi grew up in north-eastern Afghanistan, and as a child she only narrowly escaped being taken out of school herself. Her father wanted her to have a secondary education, but when he had to move to another province for work, her mother’s brothers took his place as heads of the family.

One day, when Azimi was around 12, a man saw her walking to school and told her that when she was older she would be “nice property” for someone. Her uncles said she should stop going to school because it was bringing shame on the family. Her mother, who had been forced to leave school herself at a similar age, persuaded them to let Azimi keep going so long as she wore a burqa.

Azimi finished secondary school and went to study Persian literature at university. It was there she became an activist: she and a group of friends used to visit schools and give talks to the girls on women’s rights. She carried on with activism after university, combining it with a management job at a school. When the Taliban stopped girls from going to secondary school, Azimi knew straight away what she had to do. First she asked her friends who had fled Afghanistan to send her some money. Then she got in touch with Muradi, an old friend, and the pair made a list of the best female teachers in the province.

One by one, Azimi visited all the teachers on the list to ask them if they would join the school (she didn’t want to risk phoning them, in case someone was listening in). She tried hard to convince them, explaining that they had a moral duty to protect the freedoms introduced by the previous government. After all, hadn’t they benefited from those freedoms themselves? Although most of the teachers were too afraid to join her, some agreed.

Muradi, now 24, was one of the first. Azimi sent me a video of one of her lessons. There are no children’s drawings on the walls of the classroom; the only signs that it’s used for teaching are the whiteboard and the timetable pinned to the door. Girls of various ages sit cross-legged on the floor, conjugating English verbs. Muradi tries to keep them engaged by calling out their names, but the atmosphere feels lethargic.

Many of the children are barely eating, Azimi told me. When the Taliban took over, Western donors suspended aid payments and America froze the $9bn that the country held in foreign reserves. This worsened a hunger crisis in the country: aid agencies estimate that a third of Afghan children don’t have enough to eat.

Muradi is hungry, too. Since she turned 18 she has been the main breadwinner in her family, providing for her younger sisters, parents and several other relatives. After losing her job at an NGO when the Taliban took over, she is now scraping by on credit and the small stipend Azimi gives her. “My sisters are often hungry. I know I don’t give them enough to eat. But they would never speak about it to anyone,” she said. “Girls of that age have pride.”

She feels very protective of her students. Next to their names on the class register are details about their families, their interests, their problems. There is Kawsar, 16, whose father died (many of the girls have dead or absent fathers). Though desperately poor, Kawsar and her sisters come to classes well prepared and ready to learn. There is Sima, 17, who always speaks up in class, and is confident enough to admit if she hasn’t done her homework. There is Nasiba, 14, who is usually underprepared for lessons – Muradi suspects she has problems at home but doesn’t dare ask her family in case it gets Nasiba into trouble.

Then there is Maryam, 17, who often has to stay at home to help with chores (something that happens more often now school is no longer “official”, she said). Maryam told me she had heard about Azimi’s school through friends, and asked her mother if she could go (she was scared to ask her father directly, she said). Her mother said no, and told Maryam that it was safer to stay at home. When she raised the subject again, her mother shut her down. “That’s enough,” she said, “you’ve studied enough.”

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240226_1843_S_SCHOOL_08.jpg)![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240226_1843_S_SCHOOL_09.jpg)

“Mother, what are you saying?” Maryam replied. “I’ve only studied till the ninth grade!” She got in touch with Azimi, who called Maryam’s mother and convinced her that school would be good for her daughter. Azimi persuaded her to talk to her husband, who gave his permission for Maryam to attend the school. Maryam’s brother, a shopkeeper, was sceptical. “And what will you do with this education, anyway, marry a Talib?” he said.

Maryam told me how scared she feels on her walk to school each day. “They don’t support us outside,” she said. When I asked who she meant she said, “You know, ordinary people. The shopkeepers, the street vendors.” It would take only one of them to report her to the Taliban for Maryam and her family to face arrest.

Pupils at the secret school are drilled on security: did they keep their notebooks and pens hidden on their way in? Were they conservatively dressed? Did they stagger their arrival times? Their teachers use Nokia “brick phones” to communicate with each other as they worry that the Taliban could hack a smartphone (it’s unclear whether the Taliban have the capacity to do this, although they have embraced technology since they were last in charge).

Muradi is afraid that one of her pupils will reveal the existence of the school to the Taliban. What if their parents don’t have an excuse ready when someone drops by and asks where their daughter is? Muradi said that since the Taliban retook power, she has realised how many of her friends, neighbours and colleagues were on their side all along. Her greatest fear is that one of the girls in her class might be working for Taliban intelligence.

Despite the risks she and her colleagues are taking, Azimi says she’s not scared. “I have this strength…and that’s not something everyone has.” She sees it as her job to embolden her staff, many of whom are terrified. “[Teaching] is not against your religion, beliefs, your culture or your people,” she tells them. “Have pride.”

Azimi also gives strength to her pupils. She knows the pressures they are under, and that those with dry lips and pale faces, who turn up in clothes that are unsuitable for the weather and are unable to focus on their work, are likely to be suffering at home. One has a brother who rips up her books. But she won’t let her students give in to despair. “It’s possible everything will change. You might need 20 years, but this is Afghanistan” she says, encouraging them to see the long view. “Be people who know something.” ■
