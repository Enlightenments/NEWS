Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter

**China** set a GDP-growth target of around 5% for 2024, the same as last year’s. But analysts warned that the figure would be harder to reach compared with 2023, when the economy benefited from reopening after the pandemic. In his keynote speech to the annual meeting of the country’s parliament, Li Qiang, the prime minister, also said that import tariffs on advanced technology would be cut in an effort to boost the economy, and that the military budget would increase by 7.2% to 1.66trn yuan ($231bn). The world’s second-largest economy is [struggling with](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/02/06/can-consumers-rescue-chinas-economy) deflation and falling property prices.

The United Nations’ special envoy said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe that members of **Hamas** raped women during the attack on October 7th. Pramila Patten said she also found evidence that some hostages endured **sexual violence**, including “sexualised torture”. Additionally she asked Israel to allow the UN to investigate sexual-violence allegations from Palestinians against Israeli forces and settlers.

The nine justices on America’s **Supreme Court** unanimously ruled that Colorado [could not remove](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/09/the-supreme-court-hints-it-will-keep-donald-trump-on-the-ballot) **Donald Trump** from its primary ballot, overturning the state’s earlier decision to kick him off for allegedly participating in insurrection. The ruling, which came one day before Colorado holds its Republican primary, is sure to quash similar efforts by other states to bar Mr Trump for his role in the January 6th Capitol riot.

[Prabowo Subianto](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/02/14/prabowo-subianto-will-be-indonesias-next-president), **Indonesia’s** incoming president, said that economic growth could reach 8% a year during his tenure. He said he planned to privatise firms and widen the tax base once he is inaugurated in October. Mr Prabowo won a general election last month by promising to continue the rapid economic growth of about 5% a year overseen by his predecessor, Joko Widodo.

Four former **Twitter** executives sued [Elon Musk](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/05/elon-musks-messiah-complex-may-bring-him-down) for over $128m in severance pay. They argue Mr Musk “manufactured” their terminations, accusing them of gross negligence and wilful misconduct in order to avoid paying their severance packages when he bought the firm, now called X. Mr Musk also faces potential class-action lawsuits from thousands of other staff he fired last year.

**Microsoft** accused the _New York Times_ of holding back a “groundbreaking new technology”. It hopes to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the _Times_ that claims that [OpenAI](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/26/meet-the-french-startup-hoping-to-take-on-openai), an artificial-intelligence company in which Microsoft has invested $13bn, illegally copied millions of articles to build its chatbot. The _Times_ is the first big American media company to sue Microsoft and OpenAI.

A writer on “SEAL Team”, a **television** show, filed a discrimination lawsuit in federal court in California against CBS and Paramount, alleging he was denied employment because he is a straight, white man. He is represented by a legal group funded by Stephen Miller, a former adviser to Mr Trump. Efforts to boost diversity in **Hollywood** are under scrutiny following the Supreme Court’s [ruling against affirmative action](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/06/29/lee-bollinger-laments-the-ruling-by-americas-supreme-court-against-affirmative-action) in June.

### Urgent Gaza ceasefire talks

With just six days to go until the eve of Ramadan—the unofficial deadline for a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas—talks in Cairo seem to be at an impasse. Representatives of Hamas arrived on Sunday but when they refused to hand over a list of names of Israeli hostages still alive in Gaza, Israel’s team stayed away. Nevertheless, there is still optimism among Egyptian and Qatari mediators that a deal can be reached to provide [urgently needed respite](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/02/29/a-new-tragedy-shows-anarchy-rules-in-gaza) during the Muslim holy month.

The Americans are also invested in the talks. They hope that a temporary ceasefire, which could last between a month and six weeks and allow for the release of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th, would lead to a more lasting one. According to sources in the Biden administration, Israel has agreed in principle to the deal, but Hamas are still playing tough.

### France guarantees abortion rights

On Monday French lawmakers voted to enshrine in the country’s constitution a “guarantee” of women’s “freedom” to have an abortion. They met at a joint session of the lower and upper houses of parliament in Versailles, a rarely convened body known as the Congress. A constitutional revision requires three-fifths of the votes.

Such cross-party support was widely expected. Last Wednesday the French senate, which is controlled by the opposition centre-right, voted overwhelmingly in favour of the bill. The revision also enjoys backing from the governing centre and the opposition left. Emmanuel Macron, the president, wants women’s freedom to have an abortion to be made “irreversible”. French politicians of all stripes have worried about the potential for a future rolling-back of such guarantees—especially since [America’s Supreme Court](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/24/the-supreme-court-erases-the-constitutional-right-to-abortion) overturned the ruling that protected abortion rights there in 2022.

### Turkey’s tightening

Turkey’s central bank had hoped that one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in the country’s history, which raised interest rates by 36.5 percentage points in eight months, would have tamed inflation by now. It has not.

The country’s base interest rate is now 45%. But government handouts have blunted the impact of the hikes. Annual inflation increased to a hair-raising 67.1% in February, according to data released earlier today, up from 64.9% in the preceding month. A 49% increase to the minimum wage, decreed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government at the end of last year, plus rising food prices, are largely to blame. Turkey’s central bank expects inflation to peak in the coming months and slow to 36% by the end of the year. Economists polled by Reuters last week were less sanguine, forecasting it to remain over 40% by year’s end.

### South Korea’s stuttering economy

With China’s anaemic economic performance suppressing demand and a downturn in the global semiconductor market hitting its most important product, South Korea’s export-driven economy has been in the doldrums. Output from the crucial manufacturing sector hit a 25-year low last year. Though inflation never reached the levels seen in America or Europe, it has hit South Korean wallets hard.

But there are some green shoots. On Monday South Korea published figures for industrial output, which increased 0.4% month on month despite a drop in chip production. And analysts predict a recovery in the semiconductor market. In January inflation was below 3% for the first time in six months; the release on Wednesday of South Korea’s consumer-price index for February will show if it has bounced back. With parliamentary elections due in April [Yoon Suk-yeol](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/18/who-is-yoon-suk-yeol-south-koreas-conservative-candidate-for-president), the country’s president, will hope this week’s data will give his party something to impress voters with.

### Long-living Spaniards

On Monday Maria Branyas will celebrate a remarkable birthday: number 117. Ms Branyas, who lives in Catalonia in Spain’s north-east, became the world’s [oldest](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/28/living-to-120-is-becoming-an-imaginable-prospect) person upon the death of Luicile Randon, a Frenchwoman, in 2023.

She is not Spain’s only silver superstar: by 2040 the country is expected to have an average lifespan of 85.8 years, overtaking [Japan](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/09/28/places-claiming-to-be-centenarian-hotspots-may-just-have-bad-data) to become the world's longest-living.

This may seem a surprise. Spaniards smoke and drink a bit more than the European average. The “Mediterranean diet” is given much credit, but there is no single such thing, and Spaniards [gobble](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2023/09/25/eating-fewer-calories-can-ward-off-ageing) ham, fried things and potatoes as well as whole grains and fresh veg. But Spain has excellent health care, and something else longevity experts point to. Ms Branyas credits “good connection with family and friends,” and reams of research back her up. Spaniards make sacrifices to live close to family, and the design of [towns](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/06/madrid-is-booming-growing-while-keeping-its-cool-will-be-the-tricky-part) encourages gatherings.
